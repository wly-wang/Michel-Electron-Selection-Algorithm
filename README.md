# Michel Electron Selection Algorithm
This is a selection algorithm designed for selecting low-energy Michel electrons produced from cosmic stopping muons. The algorithm is designed to run in ROOT, written in C++.
The algorithm can be adapted,this is specifically designed for 1 data file, which in a similar fashion, if using other data file, can make a class from ROOT and import the selection part of the algorithm into the new class.
